## Weather Project
The purpose of this small web app is to be able to search for a city, as well as click on the map to find out the weather of an area, and then recall previous seraches. 

## Use
The Map should load right away allowing the user to drag around and double click on an area which will add a marker to the closest point that the weather api can find.
The user can also search for a city, and click on the previous cards to recall the weather data, but pulling it again to keep save data to a minimum as well as update the data to the most recent availiable.
The user can also effectively reset the page using the clear entries button, however he map doesnt move.
