## Weather Project

The purpose of this small web app is to be able to search for a city, as well as click on the map to find out the weather of an area, and then recall previous seraches.

## Use

The Map should load right away allowing the user to drag around and double click on an area which will add a marker to the closest point that the weather api can find.

The user can also search for a city, and click on the previous cards to recall the weather data, but pulling it again to keep save data to a minimum as well as update the data to the most recent availiable.
The user can also effectively reset the page using the clear entries button, however he map doesnt move.

Suggesting its veiwed on mobile platforms, the screen resize should still allow all functionality.

## Summary

I found working on this project to be quite a bit of fun, with the java script seeming to work without a whole lot of hitches. the harder part was definetly getting the CSS to play nice with DOM manipulation, but over all im quite happy with how it turned out.
